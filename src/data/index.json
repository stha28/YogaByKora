      "story": "One morning, I listened to my intuition and felt the call to Indonesia, to go to Bali. In reality, I'm at the bottom of the hole, the hole of suffering. I still can't get out of this hole. I pretend not to see it, I fall into it, sometimes I come out of it, but I still go back into it far too often. Yet sometimes I see it, and I often fall in out of habit, even with my eyes open. My eyes are open because I've been working on this suffering for many years now. But the suffering is deep, it's not my fault, the road is long. That's surely why the right moment had arrived. To face my inner self head-on. To face this suffering with open eyes. The truth of suffering, declared Buddha, must be explored to its conclusion. So it was with open eyes that I set off for the first time to the other side of the world, to Indonesia, for a spiritual retreat. Having been initiated into the philosophy of yoga for years, the island of the gods is calling me. I want to go on a spiritual retreat in Bali. And why not learn more about yoga. So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and enrolled in a school in BALI for 1 month, where I did my 200H YTT. I'm immersed in Balinese culture, I'm living a most magical experience. Bali touches my heart. I come away from this experience enriched, nourished and changed. In Bali, I practice regularly in renowned studios, enriching my physical practice on a daily basis.I train and learn with teachers from all over the world. Down there, I find a great community of yogis.The energy is powerful.I find it very hard to leave this island, my first refuge. Above all, it's a profound personal experience that I've just had, and the pride of having obtained my 200H yoga teacher's diploma at the same time. I spent several months in Bali, immersing myself in Hinduism and Balinese culture, and then left for Thailand, where I learned about Buddhism and Thai culture.",

But to observe it is still to see it.Beyond not wanting to go in, I don't want to go near it. The revelation. I have to go back. I have to dig . I must experiment. I crave nourishment. I remember Buddha's words. I must continue to explore, my traumas, my anxieties, my fears to their end.",

Then I go to India for the first time. I intensify my personal physical practice by learning Ashtanga yoga with qualified teachers. Afterwards, I spent a month in a school where I took a further 300H of yoga teacher training. This time, I was introduced to various meditation practices. It was the first time I'd ever been in this field, and it was the beginning of a profound metamorphosis.",

Sometimes it's the people you meet, sometimes it's the places you find yourself. Sometimes it's both. My suffering led me to Indonesia, so in the end it's thanks to my suffering that I've come this far. Today, having learned observation and compassion, I thank my suffering, i want to thank myself.

I've been on this journey for several years now, and I'm on it every day. As you can see, yoga isn't just a physical practice, it's much more than that. It's a philosophy of life, a way of living. Yoga has literally changed my life and continues to do it  every day. It makes me free from my fears, my blockages and my suffering. It's the way of life I've chosen, the one that nourishes me, my balance, my refuge. Determined to share the transformative benefits of yoga with the world, I teach online and around the world. I teach traditional Hatha Yoga, which is my foundation, my first refuge. Meditation and pranayamas accompany all my classes, as do my precious Tibetan bowls. In reality, I have no particular style of yoga. I follow my daily flow, but above all the flow of my students. It's a moment between you and me, one-to-one or in a group, souls on a different path but who, once on the mat, are looking for the same thing: to get closer to the inner reality of their existence. My aim is for everyone to find their own path to inner peace through the various courses and practices on offer. It's thanks to my personal experience, my spiritual journey, my journey towards being, and my theoretical training, that I'm able to pass on my knowledge. Isn't it wonderful to be able to help? And if being helped makes you want to help in turn, wouldn't that be magical too? Why keep something positive within us to pass on? Yoga is a way of life. Yoga is a journey towards self-realization, yoga is a transmission. Teaching yoga in a theoretical way, but passing it on in a spiritual way. Since life is constantly changing, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow, but today I'm here and now.",
